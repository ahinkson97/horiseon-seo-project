## Introduction
Upon viewing this project persons are able to evaluate the code refactoring skills applied. 

## Description
This application provides insight on search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing and how they impact customers.

Some challenges I faced during this process were remembering to push my changes to git hub, in addition to creating a hover state for the nav bar.
